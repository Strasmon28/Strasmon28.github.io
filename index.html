                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Hi there, I'm Shawn</p>
                        <p class="lead">I started to use computers and other technology at a young age. During my time in academics, I started college early during my High School years where I started working towards an Associates Degree in Computer Science. There I learned the basic concepts of computer science as well as core programming languages such as C++, however my progress was incomplete (temporarily).</p>
                        <p class="lead">After High School, I attended college at UTRGV and earned a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. In this time, I learned the inner workings of computer devices including logical operations, binary operations, the data flow through physical parts from Motherboard to CPU to RAM and machine languages. In addition I learned how to quickly work with various new systems. I took up an internship as an IT worker for South Texas Health Systems where I utilized and developed many skills. This includes communication skills with various workers, using a ticket system to track issues, deducing new problems at a quick notice and figuring out a solution as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Looking back at my unfinished Associates degree, I decided to re-enroll and complete my degree as I was still offered the opportunity of finishing it and earning some more merit under my name.</p>
                        <p class="lead">I eventually decided to enroll in App Academy, since I decided that I would need more hands-on skills for a better chance at a future job. I realized that I could learn a lot of new skills and refine old ones in App Academy. I was able to learn many things such as JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Flask, SQL, SQLAlchemy as well as many cooperation and communication skills.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Now, here I am as a new graduate and willing to take on some job offers.
                            Perhaps, you have some offers?</p>
